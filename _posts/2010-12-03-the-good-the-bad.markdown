> We are like dwarfs on the shoulders of giants, so that we can see more than they, and things at a greater distance, not by virtue of any sharpness of sight on our part, or any physical distinction, but because we are carried high and raised up by their giant size."
\- Bernard of Chartres

Like a lot of people I want to stand out, be special, be someone great. But, with so many greats that have come before me, I feel like I am relegated to the cliché. None of my thoughts are original, nothing stands out; and if it does it's not me. I don't really fit in, I don't really stick out. I am invisible in a cliché world, living in a bad sitcom rerun.

Right now I understand Ecclesiastes, and it hurts. At some point ignorance bliss and I think I found it. Knowledge and understanding are a weight around my neck as I struggle in open seas.
