Beer and Sex. Growing up has it's benefits: Is it worth its weight?

What a pitiful time to peak, age nine. I still remember the enjoyment in his eyes, the only freedom I'll ever know. Dad was strong, Mom was young, my siblings were there. I should apologize to that poor boy, the things I did to him, the things I grow up to make him do.

He wouldn't recognize me now, the infidel of his dreams. All I ever want is his acceptance, but he could never know me. With each step, I take away part of his humanity, part of his childhood. And I wont stop; the only true crime would be believing I could freeze time.
