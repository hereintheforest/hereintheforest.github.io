The flowers are dying just so. The dawn is coming in right in front of me.

Who cares if I'm late? Who cares if I'm on time?

The room is getting cold, or, actually I'm losing heat. I can't exist in this vacuum for long.

Take me back there, to the warmth. I'm tired of thinking and we've only just begun.
