Had an awesome time today hanging out with some of the peeps from the coffee shop like Jordan and a Canadian named Blossom. I made some pretty good, and only slightly doughy, pizza. I hope to have a school potluck/family-time once a week. And, to my surprise, early this morning I found that sometimes sleep isn't necessary! I found these songs while staying up until 4:30am to do math, enjoy!

* Just Glide - Lost Ocean
* Protection - Future Of Forestry
