There's a little bit of each. Both death and life in every meeting. I've made more that my fair share of mistakes though, and I know it's over.

It's over. It's over. It never could have been. It never will be.

Not so hung up on this as I present. It's everyday. Distance makes me more real, more sober. The gravity is apparent in our every step. Every step.
