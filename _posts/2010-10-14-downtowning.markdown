I had a lot fun hanging out with my awesome cousins in Portland last weekend. My first night there we were going to see a movie, but as luck would have it, they hated minors or something. So, after (unsuccessfully) trying to tell them that we had never set foot in a mine, we decided to find someplace to eat. After a while we got tired of driving around and decided just go walking downtown which was amazing (other than the fact that I got completely soaked).

All in all I had a pretty amazing time and I'm hopping to go back there some time soon. But back to school work for now.
