Some pictures only look right in the dim light. Some paintings only break your heart if you squint.

I met you in the void. You were looking for something greater and you settled. How could I ever be entirely entranced?

Years of unlearning to complete in days, all while navigating mazes. Hollywood eat your heart out, I'm tired of your pseudo realism.

To be consumed, that's all we asked. To bad we're both perfectionists and this is a task for the gods.

Keep walking straight. Keep moving on. The best and worst is behind us.
