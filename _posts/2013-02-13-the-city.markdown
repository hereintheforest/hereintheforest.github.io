Welcome to the holy city. Welcome to the land of over-aged high-schoolers and unemployed mothers.

Welcome to the holy city, we have no life. Alone in our patterns, our thoughts and our feelings.

There is no cast, no race; there is only ambition, only ambition to distinguish us.

We're going to shake this town, this holy suburbia. We'll break it off our backs and never look back.

Welcome to the holy city. Welcome to the city of second chances and acid rain. We hope you'll stay a while 'cause we've done our time.
